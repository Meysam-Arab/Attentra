# Attentra
Atentra is a comprehensive program designed to track and manage the presence and absence of individuals. Users can register different people at various locations by defining each place within the app. These locations can include a company, factory, school, home, or any other specific area.

Individuals can check in and out in two ways: 
1. Using QR codes generated for each person. 
2. Through the location services and mobile phones of employees.

In this system, mobile phones serve as a replacement for traditional attendance devices, allowing any mobile phone with a camera and internet access to be used. Another feature of this system is the ability to track different individuals, which is helpful for confirming their locations in various situations. Additionally, the program allows users to assign tasks to registered individuals.
